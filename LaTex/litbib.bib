@article{Ahsan,
 abstract = {Heart disease, one of the main reasons behind the high mortality rate around the world, requires a sophisticated and expensive diagnosis process. In the recent past, much literature has demonstrated machine learning approaches as an opportunity to efficiently diagnose heart disease patients. However, challenges associated with datasets such as missing data, inconsistent data, and mixed data (containing inconsistent missing data both as numerical and categorical) are often obstacles in medical diagnosis. This inconsistency led to a higher probability of misprediction and a misled result. Data preprocessing steps like feature reduction, data conversion, and data scaling are employed to form a standard dataset---such measures play a crucial role in reducing inaccuracy in final prediction. This paper aims to evaluate eleven machine learning (ML) algorithms---Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), AdaBoost (AB), Extra Tree Classifier (ET)---and six different data scaling methods---Normalization (NR), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA), Robust Scaler (RS), and Quantile Transformer (QT) on a dataset comprising of information of patients with heart disease. The result shows that CART, along with RS or QT, outperforms all other ML algorithms with 100{\%} accuracy, 100{\%} precision, 99{\%} recall, and 100{\%} F1 score. The study outcomes demonstrate that the model's performance varies depending on the data scaling method.},

@article{Alzubaidi,
 abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we have extended the well-established universal approximator theory to neural networks that use the unbounded ReLU activation function and a nonlinear softmax output layer. We have proved that a sufficiently large neural network using the ReLU activation function can approximate any function in {\$}L{\^{}}1{\$} up to any arbitrary precision. Moreover, our theoretical results have shown that a large enough neural network using a nonlinear softmax output layer can also approximate any indicator function in {\$}L{\^{}}1{\$}, which is equivalent to mutually-exclusive class labels in any realistic multiple-class pattern classification problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical justification for using the softmax output layers in neural networks for pattern classification.},

@article{Bellows,
 abstract = {Abstract. The current Air Force High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) Materials Damage Tolerance Program investigating the fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V requires the determination of initiation-based endurance limits both with and without associated damage modes. Step testing was evaluated as a means of generating endurance limits with a single specimen for the purpose of evaluating associated damage mode states. Notched specimens were evaluated in order to determine the effect of notches on the fatigue behavior so that geometrical effects associated with damage modes could be separated from non-geometrical (e.g., plasticity, residual stresses, cracking) effects. As part of this program, smooth bar S-N curves were generated at four stress ratios ($-$1, 0.1, 0.5, and 0.8) and compared to endurance limits determined by the step test method using a single specimen. Notch fatigue was conducted at two stress ratios and compared to smooth bar fatigue, and the effect of notch geometry and sampling volume under the notches was examined at a stress ratio of 0.1. The step test method agreed with the conventional S-N curve determined endurance limit in most cases. The different notch geometries and sampling volumes did not appear to effect notch fatigue behavior. This paper presents some of the preliminary results of this ongoing effort.},

@article{Burhan,
 abstract = {S-N behavior has been a backbone of material fatigue life studies since the 19th century. Numerous S-N curve models have been produced but they have been arbitrarily chosen in numerous research works dominantly for composite materials. In this paper, they were critically reviewed and evaluated for capability using the following criteria: data fitting capability, efficiency of curve fitting, applicability to data sets at various stress ratios ($-$0.43, $-$1, $-$3, 0.1, and 10), representability of fatigue damage at failure, and satisfaction of the initial boundary condition. The S-N curve models were found to be in two categories---one for fatigue data characterization independent of stress ratio, and the other for those designed for predicting the effect of stress ratio. The models proposed by Weibull, Sendeckyj, and Kim and Zhang for fatigue data characterization appeared to have the best capabilities for experimental data obtained from Weibull for R = $-$1, from Sendeckyj for R = 0.1, and from Kawai and Itoh (for R = $-$0.43, $-$3, and 10). The Kim and Zhang model was found to have an advantage over the Weibull and the Sendeckyj models for representing the fatigue damage at failure. The Kohout and Vechet model was also found to have a good fitting capability but with an inherent limitation for shaping the S-N curve at some stress ratios (e.g., R = $-$0.43). The S-N curve models developed for predicting the effect of stress ratio were found to be relatively inferior in data fitting capability to those developed directly for fatigue data characterization.},

@article{Cai,
 abstract = {Abstract. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

Finally, the third section shows how these principles can be applied to a number of different fields related to the cognitive sciences, including control, speech recognition, robotics, image processing, and cognitive psychology. The volume is designed to provide both a solid theoretical foundation and a set of examples that show the versatility of the concepts. Useful to experts in the field, it should also be most helpful to students seeking to understand the basic principles of connectionist learning and to engineers wanting to add neural networks in general -- and backpropagation in particular -- to their set of problem-solving methods.},

@article{Cuomo,
 abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

 abstract = {Topologically stable magnetic skyrmion has a much lower depinning current density that may be useful for memory as well as neuromorphic computing. However, skyrmion-based devices suffer from the Magnus force originating from the skyrmion Hall effect, which may result in unwanted skyrmion annihilation if the magnitude of the driving current gets too large. A design of an artificial neuron and a synapse using a synthetic antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer device, which nullifies the Magnus force, is demonstrated in this work. The leak term in the artificial leaky integrate-and-fire neuron is achieved by engineering the uniaxial anisotropy profile of the neuronal device. The synaptic device has a similar structure as the neuronal device but has a constant uniaxial anisotropy. The synaptic device also has a linear and symmetric weight update, which is a highly desirable trait of an artificial synapse. Neuronal and synaptic devices based on magnetic domain-wall (DW) motion are also studied and compared to skyrmionic devices. Our simulation results show the energy required to perform such operation in DW or skyrmion-based devices is on the order of a few fJ.},

@article{Dong,
 abstract = {As reported in the last OMAE conference (Dong, 2003), a robust structural stress method has been developed and validated for fatigue evaluation of ship structures through a major joint industry project. The structural stress method not only provides a consistent method for characterizing stress concentration effects on fatigue in different joint types and loading modes, but also offers a rapid estimation procedure for stress intensity factors for arbitrary joint geometries and loading modes in fracture mechanics context. As a result, a master S-N curve approach has been recently developed by using the mesh-insensitive structural stress parameter and its direct linkage to fracture mechanics principles. The master S-N curve is described by an equivalent structural stress range parameter which provides a single parameter description of stress concentration effects, thickness effects, and loading mode effects on fatigue in welded joints. A massive amount of S-N data since 1947, encompassing drastically different joint types, plate thickness, and loading modes have been used to validate the effectiveness of the master S-N curve approach. With the master S-N curve method, plate joints in ship structures, tubular joints in offshore structures, as well as pipe joints for riser applications can be collapsed into a singe curve, referred to as the master S-N curve. This paper provides the detailed theoretical development, application examples, and validation results. The applications for the master S-N curve approach will be illustrated by using various offshore/marine examples.},

 abstract = {The various studies of partial differential equations (PDEs) are hot topics of mathematical research. Among them, solving PDEs is a very important and difficult task. Since many partial differential equations do not have analytical solutions, numerical methods are widely used to solve PDEs. Although numerical methods have been widely used with good performance, researchers are still searching for new methods for solving partial differential equations. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing. Studies have shown that deep neural networks have powerful function-fitting capabilities and have great potential in the study of partial differential equations. In this paper, we introduce an improved Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving partial differential equations. PINN takes the physical information that is contained in partial differential equations as a regularization term, which improves the performance of neural networks. In this study, we use the method to study the wave equation, the KdV--Burgers equation, and the KdV equation. The experimental results show that PINN is effective in solving partial differential equations and deserves further research.},

The last decade has brought dramatic changes in the way that researchers analyze economic and financial time series. This book synthesizes these recent advances and makes them accessible to first-year graduate students. James Hamilton provides the first adequate text-book treatments of important innovations such as vector autoregressions, generalized method of moments, the economic and statistical consequences of unit roots, time-varying variances, and nonlinear time series models. In addition, he presents basic tools for analyzing dynamic systems (including linear representations, autocovariance generating functions, spectral analysis, and the Kalman filter) in a way that integrates economic theory with the practical difficulties of analyzing and interpreting real-world data. Time Series Analysis fills an important need for a textbook that integrates economic theory, econometrics, and new results. The book is intended to provide students and researchers with a self-contained survey of time series analysis. It starts from first principles and should be readily accessible to any beginning graduate student, while it is also intended to serve as a reference book for researchers},

 abstract = {Abstract. As a transmission component, the gear has been obtained widespread attention. The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of gear is critical to the prognostics health management (PHM) of gear transmission systems. The digital twin (DT) provides support for gear RUL prediction with the advantages of rich health information data and accurate health indicators (HI). This paper reviews digital twin-driven RUL prediction methods for gear performance degradation, from the view of digital twin-driven physical model-based and virtual model-based prediction method. From the view of the physical model-based one, it includes a prediction model based on gear crack, gear fatigue, gear surface scratch, gear tooth breakage, and gear permanent deformation. From the view of the digital twin-driven virtual model-based one, it includes non-deep learning methods and deep learning methods.

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW

With the unprecedented advancement of data aggregation and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform the practice of medicine. The field of orthopedics, in particular, is uniquely suited to harness the power of big data, and in doing so provide critical insight into elevating the many facets of care provided by orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the recent and novel literature regarding ML in the field of orthopedics and to address its potential impact on the future of musculoskeletal care.

RECENT FINDINGS

Recent literature demonstrates that the incorporation of ML into orthopedics has the potential to elevate patient care through alternative patient-specific payment models, rapidly analyze imaging modalities, and remotely monitor patients. Just as the business of medicine was once considered outside the domain of the orthopedic surgeon, we report evidence that demonstrates these emerging applications of AI warrant ownership, leverage, and application by the orthopedic surgeon to better serve their patients and deliver optimal, value-based care.},

 abstract = {In recent times, deep artificial neural networks have achieved many successes in pattern recognition. Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series classification with neural networks. We propose a taxonomy and outline the four families in time series data augmentation, including transformation-based methods, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition methods. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods on 128 time series classification datasets with six different types of neural networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data augmentation for neural network applications.},

 abstract = {Multispectral imaging (MSI) was implemented to develop a burn tissue classification device to assist burn surgeons in planning and performing debridement surgery. To build a classification model via machine learning, training data accurately representing the burn tissue was needed, but assigning raw MSI data to appropriate tissue classes is prone to error. We hypothesized that removing outliers from the training dataset would improve classification accuracy. A swine burn model was developed to build an MSI training database and study an algorithm's burn tissue classification abilities. After the ground-truth database was generated, we developed a multistage method based on Z -test and univariate analysis to detect and remove outliers from the training dataset. Using 10-fold cross validation, we compared the algorithm's accuracy when trained with and without the presence of outliers. The outlier detection and removal method reduced the variance of the training data. Test accuracy was improved from 63{\%} to 76{\%}, matching the accuracy of clinical judgment of expert burn surgeons, the current gold standard in burn injury assessment. Given that there are few surgeons and facilities specializing in burn care, this technology may improve the standard of burn care for patients without access to specialized facilities.},

 abstract = {Machine learning studies automatic algorithms that improve themselves through experience. It is widely used for analyzing and extracting value from large biomedical data sets, or ``big biomedical data,'' advancing biomedical research, and improving healthcare. Before a machine learning model is trained, the user of a machine learning software tool typically must manually select a machine learning algorithm and set one or more model parameters termed hyper-parameters. The algorithm and hyper-parameter values used can greatly impact the resulting model's performance, but their selection requires special expertise as well as many labor-intensive manual iterations. To make machine learning accessible to layman users with limited computing expertise, computer science researchers have proposed various automatic selection methods for algorithms and/or hyper-parameter values for a given supervised machine learning problem. This paper reviews these methods, identifies several of their limitations in the big biomedical data environment, and provides preliminary thoughts on how to address these limitations. These findings establish a foundation for future research on automatically selecting algorithms and hyper-parameter values for analyzing big biomedical data.},

@book{Murphy,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online{\textquotedbl}--Back cover},

@book{Theodoridis,
 abstract = {This tutorial text gives a unifying perspective on machine learning by covering both~probabilistic and deterministic approaches -which are based on optimization techniques - together with the Bayesian inference approach, whose essence lies~in the use of a hierarchy of probabilistic models.  The book presents the major machine learning methods as they have been developed in different disciplines, such as statistics, statistical and adaptive signal processing and computer science. Focusing on the physical reasoning behind the mathematics, all the various methods and techniques are explained in depth, supported by examples and problems, giving an invaluable resource to the student and researcher for understanding and applying machine learning concepts.The book builds carefully from the basic classical methods~ to ~the most recent trends, with chapters written to be as self-contained as possible, making the text suitable for ~different courses: pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models.All major classical techniques: Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods.The latest trends: Sparsity, convex analysis and optimization, online distributed algorithms, learning in RKH spaces, Bayesian inference, graphical and hidden Markov models, particle filtering, deep learning, dictionary learning and latent variables modeling.Case studies - protein folding prediction, optical character recognition, text authorship identification, fMRI data analysis, change point detection, hyperspectral image unmixing, target localization, channel equalization and echo cancellation, show how the theory can be applied.MATLAB code for all the main algorithms are available on an accompanying website, enabling the reader to experiment with the code. Sergios Theodoridis is Professor of Signal Processing and Machine Learning in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Athens.  He is the co-author of the bestselling book, Pattern Recognition, and the co-author of Introduction to Pattern Recognition: A MATLAB Approach.  He serves as Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, and he is the co-Editor in Chief with Rama Chellapa for the Academic  Press Library in Signal Processing.  He has received a number of awards including the 2014 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Best Paper Award, the 2009 IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Transactions on Neural Networks Outstanding Paper Award, the 2014 IEEE Signal Processing Society Education Award, the EURASIP 2014 Meritorious Service Award, and he has served as a Distinguished Lecturer for the IEEE Signal Processing Society and the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.

 abstract = {Deep learning's recent history has been one of achievement: from triumphing over humans in the game of Go to world-leading performance in image classification, voice recognition, translation, and other tasks. But this progress has come with a voracious appetite for computing power. This article catalogs the extent of this dependency, showing that progress across a wide variety of applications is strongly reliant on increases in computing power. Extrapolating forward this reliance reveals that progress along current lines is rapidly becoming economically, technically, and environmentally unsustainable. Thus, continued progress in these applications will require dramatically more computationally-efficient methods, which will either have to come from changes to deep learning or from moving to other machine learning methods.},

 abstract = {Most vehicle-gearboxes operating today are designed for a{\&}nbsp;limited service-life. On the one hand, this creates significant potential for decreasing cost and mass as well as reduction of the carbon-footprint. On the other hand, this causes a{\&}nbsp;rising risk of failure with increasing operating time of the machine. Especially if a{\&}nbsp;failure can result in a{\&}nbsp;high economic loss, this fact creates a{\&}nbsp;conflict of goals. On the one hand, the machine should only be maintained or replaced when necessary and, on the other hand, the probability of a{\&}nbsp;failure increases with longer operating times. Therefore, a{\&}nbsp;method is desirable, making it possible to predict the remaining service-life and state of health with as little effort as possible. Centerpiece of gearboxes are the gears. A{\&}nbsp;failure of these components usually causes the whole gearbox to fail. The fatigue life analysis deals with the dimensioning of gears according to the expected loads and the required service-life. Unfortunately, there is very little possibility to validate the technical design during operation, today. Hence, the goal of this paper is to present a{\&}nbsp;method, enabling the prediction of the remaining-service-life and state-of-health of gears during operation. Within this method big-data and machine-learning approaches are used. The method is designed in a{\&}nbsp;way, enabling an easy transfer to other machine elements and kinds of machinery.},

The book explores the geometric and kinematic design of the various types of gears most commonly used in practical applications, also considering the problems concerning their cutting processes. The cylindrical spur and helical gears are first considered, determining their main geometric quantities in the light of interference and undercut problems, as well as the related kinematic parameters. Particular attention is paid to the profile shift of these types of gears either generated by rack-type cutter or by pinion-rack cutter. Among other things, profile-shifted toothing allows to obtain teeth shapes capable of greater strength and more balanced specific sliding, as well as to reduce the number of teeth below the minimum one to avoid the operating interference or undercut. These very important aspects of geometric-kinematic design of cylindrical spur and helical gears are then generalized and extended to the other examined types of gears most commonly used in practical applications, such as: straight bevel gears; crossed helical gears; worm gears; spiral bevel and hypoid gears. Finally, ordinary gear trains, planetary gear trains and face gear drives are discussed. Includes fully-developed exercises to draw the reader's attention to the problems that are of interest to the designer, as well as to clarify the calculation procedure Topics are addressed from a theoretical standpoint, but in such a way as not to lose sight of the physical phenomena that characterize the various types of gears which are examined The analytical and numerical solutions are formulated so as to be of interest not only to academics, but also to designers who deal with actual engineering problems concerning the gears.},

The superior performance of deep neural networks relies heavily on alarge number of training data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled dataof many real-world time series applications may be limited such asclassification in medical time series and anomaly detection in AIOps. As aneffective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, dataaugmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning modelson time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different dataaugmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewedmethods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlightingtheir strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different dataaugmentation methods for different tasks including time series classification,anomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight fivefuture directions to provide useful research guidance.},

@article{Yaguo,
 abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) refers to applications of machine learning theories to machine fault diagnosis. This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this field.},

 abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.  Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice.  We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},
